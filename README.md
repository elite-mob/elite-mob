Hi, I’m Hans.

I’m a senior full-stack software engineer focused on building production-ready web and mobile applications for real users. I’ve shipped and maintained systems end to end, from product discovery and UI design through backend implementation, deployment, and long-term support.

My work spans backend, frontend, mobile, and infrastructure. I build complete products, not just features. That includes public-facing websites, internal dashboards, mobile apps, admin panels, and integrations that actually hold up in production.

You can find more about my work and background at https://elite-mob.github.io.

What I focus on day to day:
- Backend development with Node.js and Python, building REST and event-driven systems, background jobs, third-party integrations, and payment flows
- Frontend development with TypeScript and React, focusing on performance, state management, and pragmatic UX
- Mobile development using React Native, including native iOS and Android integrations, app architecture, performance tuning, and store releases
- Data and persistence with SQL, schema design, migrations, reporting, and data integrity
- Infrastructure on AWS, using Docker, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and production incident handling
- System design and architecture, making tradeoffs that keep systems understandable and scalable over time
- AI and machine learning integrations, including production use of LLMs with attention to cost control, validation, and reliability

I prefer boring, well-understood solutions over clever ones. I care about clean ownership, predictable behavior, and code that’s still easy to reason about months after it ships.

If you have a project in mind, feel free to reach out to discuss it further.
I focus on delivering work that’s actually useful, shipped cleanly, and handled professionally from start to finish.
