Hi, I'm Hans.

I’m a senior software engineer focused on building and maintaining production systems that serve real users under real constraints. I’ve owned features and platforms end to end, from early design through deployment, monitoring, and long-term maintenance.

My work spans backend, frontend, mobile, and infrastructure. I’ve built APIs, data pipelines, internal tools, mobile apps, and customer-facing applications, and I’m comfortable moving across the stack when the problem requires it. I care a lot about correctness, clear ownership, and systems that are easy to reason about when something breaks.

Core areas I work in:
- Backend: Node.js, Python, REST and event-driven systems, background jobs, integrations, payments
- Frontend: TypeScript, React, state management, performance, pragmatic UX
- Mobile: React Native, native iOS and Android integrations, app architecture, performance, store releases
- Data: SQL, schema design, migrations, reporting, data integrity
- Infrastructure: AWS, Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, incident response
- Architecture: system design, tradeoffs, scalability, and long-term maintainability
- AI systems: integrating LLMs into production with attention to cost, validation, and reliability

I prefer boring, well-understood solutions over clever ones. I value code that’s easy to debug, test, and hand off. Most of my decisions are driven by how the system will behave six months from now, not how impressive it looks today.
